  text1: |
    The goal of **NEARDATA** is to create an extreme data infrastructure mediating data flows between Object
    Storage and Data Analytics platforms across the Compute Continuum. Our novel XtremeDataHub platform
    is an intermediary data service that intercepts and optimises data flows (S3 API, stream APIs) with highperformance near-data connectors (Cloud/Edge). Finally, our unique Data Broker service will provide secure
    data access and orchestration of dispersed data sources thanks to TEEs and federated learning architectures.
    Our NEARDATA platform is a novel technology for data mining of large and dispersed unstructured data sets
    that can be deployed in the Cloud and in the Edge (HPC, IoT Devices), that leverages advanced AI technologies
    and offers a novel confidential cybersecurity layer for trusted data computation.

    The goals of NearData are the following:
      - **Provide high-performance near-data processing for Extreme Data Types:** The first objective is to create a
        novel intermediary data service (XtremeDataHub) providing serverless data connectors that optimize data management operations
        (partitioning, filtering, transformation, aggregation) and interactive queries (search, discovery, matching,
        multi-object queries) to efficiently present data to analytics platforms. Our data connectors facilitate a elas-
        tic data-driven process-then-compute paradigm which significantly reduces data communication on the
        data interconnect, ultimately resulting in higher overall data throughput.
      - **Support real-time video streams but also event streams that must be ingested and processed very fast to
        Object Storage:** The second objective is to seamlessly combine streaming and batch data processing for
        analytics. To this end, we will develop stream data connectors deployed as stream operators offering very
        fast stateful computations over low-latency event and video streams.
      - The third objective is to **create a Data Broker service enabling trustworthy data sharing and confidential orchestration of data pipelines across the Compute Continuum**. We will provide secure data orchestration, transfer, processing and access thanks to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and federated learning architectures.
