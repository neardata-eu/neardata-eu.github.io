This workshop was organized by EU-funded projects: EXTRACT, ASCENDER, VERGE, Cloudskin, and NEARDATA who presented novel approaches and solutions targeting key aspects of the compute continuum design. This included AI and data-driven service and resource orchestration, data management and security for extreme data, parallel and distributed architectures, and integration with 5G and beyond communication networks.
