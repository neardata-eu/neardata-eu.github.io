<p>As part of the Horizon Europe funding programme, seven pioneering projects have received funding to address the challenges posed by extreme data generated by IoT, industrial, business, administration, environmental, scientific and societal sources. These projects are pursuing innovative approaches that integrate cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Edge/Fog/Cloud Computing. </p>

<p>Under the 2022 Horizon Europe call for Digital and Space, topic “World Leading Data and Computing Technologies”, the EU recognises the intrinsic value of data for EU’s competitiveness. Projects funded under the cluster HORIZON-CL4-2022-DATA-01-05 - Extreme data mining, aggregation and analytics technologies and solutions seek to securely extract meaningful insights from raw data, facilitating advanced decision-making strategies. </p>

<h2>Methodology and Novelty</h2>
Through unique methodologies and application cases, each of the seven projects contribute to strengthening European capacities for agile responses to urgent needs by developing and enabling the uptake of the next generation of computing and data technologies and infrastructures. Operating within the framework of European values, the projects emphasise human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, promoting trustworthy technology that empowers end-users.</p>

<p>The projects leverage innovative infrastructures, converging and working seamlessly across the compute continuum. With diverse application cases, ranging from crisis management, mobility, to food security, the projects aim to bring their innovative work closer to end-users, making it a reality for them. </p>

<p><b>The Cluster Objectives</b><br/> 
The cluster is dedicated to fostering a vibrant community within the seven projects. By creating a space for exchange, knowledge-sharing and network-sharing the cluster aims to create a synergetic ecosystem. This collaborative effort maximises the impact of the projects by enhancing communication networks and facilitating exchange, with partners from across Europe, showcasing the effectiveness of Horizon Europe and laying the foundation for future collaborations. </p>
