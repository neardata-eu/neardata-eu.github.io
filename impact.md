                Scientifically, the project advances the state of the art by establishing scalable, interoperable, and reproducible frameworks for data-intensive biomedical research. Across genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, surgical video analysis, and pathogen surveillance, a shared focus lies on overcoming fragmentation, data scarcity, and heterogeneity. By integrating AI, high-performance and cloud computing, and standardized workflows, the work enables researchers to uncover complex biological patterns, refined models, and generate insights that were previously computationally or logistically infeasible.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                A unifying contribution is the development and validation of novel methodological building blocks with broad applicability. These include privacy-preserving learning paradigms, efficient data access mechanisms, composable workflows, and optimized pipelines that generalize beyond individual domains. The creation of high-quality datasets, benchmarks, and reference atlases further strengthens the scientific ecosystem by enabling reproducibility, comparative evaluation, and cross-institutional collaboration.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                Importantly, the project demonstrates how cutting-edge computation can coexist with strict data governance. By embedding confidentiality, provenance, and security directly into scientific workflows, it opens new research directions in trusted and federated biomedical computing.

    <!-- 2. ECONOMIC IMPACT (Zig-Zag: Image Left, Text Right) -->

            <h3 class="section-heading">Economic Impact</h3>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                The economic impact across the five use cases is driven by increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved sustainability of biomedical computing and healthcare workflows. By shifting from monolithic, resource-intensive approaches to elastic, cloud-native, and serverless models, the project demonstrates substantial reductions in computation time, infrastructure usage, and operational expenses. These gains are achieved while maintaining or improving analytical performance, making advanced biomedical analysis economically viable at scale.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                A shared economic benefit lies in the reusability and modularity of the developed solutions. Optimized pipelines, federated learning frameworks, and interoperable platforms can be readily adopted by research institutions, healthcare providers, SMEs, and industry partners. This reduces duplication of effort, lowers entry barriers for innovation, and accelerates time-to-market for new services and products.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                Finally, the project contributes to long-term economic sustainability by promoting greener and more efficient use of computational resources. Reduced data movement, targeted scaling, and early stopping mechanisms decrease energy consumption and environmental impact.

            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                Across all five use cases, the project delivers a strong societal impact by advancing data-driven, preventive, and patient-centered healthcare while reinforcing public trust in digital technologies. By enabling earlier detection of disease risks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and supporting real-time clinical and public health decision-making, the work contributes directly to better health outcomes and increased resilience of healthcare systems.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                A key commonality is the democratization of access to advanced biomedical data and analytical capabilities. Federated infrastructures, interoperable repositories, and scalable workflows allow clinicians, researchers, and public health institutions to work with high-quality data regardless of location or local infrastructure constraints. This reduces inequalities between institutions and regions, fosters collaboration across borders, and accelerates the translation of research into clinical and public health practice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                Privacy, security, and ethical data use are central societal enablers across all use cases. The adoption of privacy-preserving technologies—such as federated learning, trusted execution environments, and secure data connectors—ensures that sensitive health data can be analyzed responsibly and in compliance with regulations.
