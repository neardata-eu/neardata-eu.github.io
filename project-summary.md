</div>

<div class="container text-justify">
    <p>The NEARDATA project, a research project funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme, has successfully completed its mission to build a world-class platform for extreme near-data processing. By bringing computation directly to where data is stored, the project has removed critical bottlenecks in managing massive datasets across the "compute continuum", from local hospital devices to massive cloud infrastructures.</p>

    <p>The project has developed <strong>innovative technologies for Extreme Data Processing</strong> like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A fully-fledged <strong>Extreme Data Hub</strong> (pyrun.cloud) including a full-fledged DataCockpit including many data connectors for scientific formats, and an optimized data processing platform (Lithops, Dask) including the different pipelines developed in the project.</li>
        <li>A <strong>Confidential Data Broker</strong> adapted to confidential federated learning deployments that has been implemented over SCONE software, and validated in Surgery use cases.</li>
        <li>A <strong>Stream Processing platform</strong> ensuring low-latency and elastic edge data processing that was built on top of Dell’s Pravega system and validated in Surgery and Genomics use cases.</li>
        <li>An international <strong>Extreme Data Hub in Metabolomics</strong> (Metaspace) with optimized extreme data pipelines providing processed information to AI pipelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Breakthrough Achievements in Public Health</h4>
    <p>The project’s most tangible impacts are found in its five specialized medical and scientific use cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Developed StreamSense, a semantic search engine that allows surgeons to find specific moments in surgical video archives in less than 30 milliseconds. This drastically accelerates AI training for real-time surgical assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Created predictive models to identify genetic predispositions for Type 2 Diabetes, helping move healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Pathogen Tracking:</strong> Developed the KPop algorithm for the rapid tracking and classification of pathogens, a vital tool for managing future pandemics and food security.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetics Research:</strong> Optimized the Transcriptomics Atlas pipeline, reducing the computing costs and time required to process RNA sequences by two orders of magnitude.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolomics:</strong> Optimized metabolomics pipelines (included in the popular datahub METASPACE) that allow researchers to securely access and analyze molecular data across heterogeneous repositories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Europe’s Global Leadership</h4>
    <p>NEARDATA has firmly positioned Europe as a leader in "extreme data" and digital sovereignty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scientific Excellence:</strong> The consortium produced 42 scientific publications, with 38% appearing in elite global venues like Nature Communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sovereignty:</strong> By pioneering Confidential Computing and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), the project ensures that sensitive European health data remains secure and under European control.</li>
        <li><strong>The DataNexus Cluster:</strong> NEARDATA led the formation of a cluster of seven EU projects collaborating to solve the world's most complex data mining and analytics challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Future Development and Economic Potential</h4>
    <p>The technologies developed are designed for wide-scale industrial and commercial adoption:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial Integration:</strong> Global partners like Dell Technologies are exploring the integration of NEARDATA’s search and analytics engines into commercial products like NativeEdge and Data Lakehouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowering SMEs:</strong> Platforms like PyRun (from URV) eliminate the "complexity tax" of cloud computing for Python developers. PyRun was also integrated in the open source OpenNebula platform. Meanwhile, Scontain provides "sconified" services that allow small and medium enterprises to use advanced AI while meeting the strictest security regulations.</li>
    </ul>
